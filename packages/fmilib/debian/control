Description: FMI Library
 FMI Library (FMIL) is a software package written in C that enables integration
 of Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) import in applications. FMI Library is an
 independent open-source implementation of the FMI open standard
 (www.fmi-standard.org). The library provides a C API for interacting with all
 parts of FMUs, including unzipping, loading of shared object files (DLLs)
 contained in FMUs, as well as parsing of XML model metadata files. The user is
 thereby relieved from managing the details of FMU interaction, which
 significantly reduce the time required to implement FMU import capabilities.
